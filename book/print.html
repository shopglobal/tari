<p>Tari is a community-driven project. The documents presented in this RFC collection have typically gone through several
iterations before reaching this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideas and questions are posted in #tari-dev on <a href="https://freenode.net/">#FreeNode IRC</a>. This is typically short-form
content with rapid feedback. Often, these conversations will lead to someone posting a proposal as a <a href="https://github.com/tari-project/RFC/pulls" title="Tari RFC pull requests">pull request</a> into
<a href="https://github.com/tari-project/RFC/tree/master/proposals" title="Tari proposals">proposals</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tari-project/RFC/tree/master/proposals" title="Tari proposals">Proposals</a> get debated and refined using Github's Review and <a href="https://github.com/tari-project/RFC/pulls" title="Tari RFC pull requests">pull request</a> systems. After the content has
stabilised, and the community accepts the proposal, it can be written up as a formal RFC.</li>
<li>RFCs are &quot;Requests for Comment&quot;, so although the proposals in these documents are usually well-thought out, they are
not cast in stone. RFCs can, and should, undergo further evaluation and discussion by the community. RFC comments are
best made using Github <a href="https://github.com/tari-project/RFC/issues" title="Tari RFC Issues">issues</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>New RFC's should follow the format given in the <a href="./RFC_template.html">RFC template</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#lifecycle" id="lifecycle"><h2>Lifecycle</h2></a>
<p>RFCs go through the following lifecycle, which roughly corresponds to the <a href="https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS/">COSS</a>:</p>

<p>The Tari network is composed of two layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>The base layer deals with <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">Tari coin</a>s. It governed by a proof-of-work blockchain that is merged-mined with
Monero. The base layer is highly secure, decentralised and relatively slow.</li>
<li>The digital assets network runs on a second layer. This layer manages all things to do with native digital assets. It
is built for liveness, speed and scalability at the expense of decentralisation.</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#currency-tokens-and-digital-assets" id="currency-tokens-and-digital-assets"><h3>Currency tokens and digital assets</h3></a>
<p>There are two major digital entities on the Tari network: The coins that are the unit of transfer for the Tari
cryptocurrency, and the digital assets that could represent anything from tickets to in-game items.</p>
<p>Tari coins are the fuel that drives the entire Tari ecosystem. But they share many of the properties of money, and so
security is a non-negotiable requirement. In a cryptocurrency context, this is usually achieved by employing a
decentralised network running a censorship-resistant protocol like Nakamoto consensus over a proof of work blockchain.
As we know, proof of work blockchains are not scalable, or terribly fast.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Tari network will be used to create and manage digital assets.</p>
<p>In Tari parlance, a digital asset is defined as a finite set of digital stateful tokens that are governed by predefined
rules. A single digital asset may define anything from one to thousands of tokens within its scope.</p>
<p>For example, in a ticketing context, an <em>event</em> will be an asset. The asset definition will allocate tokens representing
the tickets for that event. The ticket tokens will have state, such as its current owner and whether it has been
redeemed or not. Users might be interacting with digital assets hundreds of times a second, and state updates need to be
propagated and agreed upon by the network very quickly. A blockchain-enabled ticketing system is practically useless if
a user has to wait for &quot;3 block confirmations&quot; before the bouncer will let her into a venue. Users expect near-instant
state updates because centralised solutions offer them that today.</p>
<p>Therefore the Tari digital assets network must offer speed and scalability.</p>
<a class="header" href="#two-layers" id="two-layers"><h4>Two layers</h4></a>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">distributed system trilemma</a> tells us that these requirements are
mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>We can't have fast, cheap digital assets and also highly secure and decentralised currency tokens on a single system.</p>
<p>Tari overcomes this constraint by building two layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A base layer that provides a public ledger of Tari coin transactions, secured by proof of work to maximise security, and</li>
<li>A second layer that manages digital asset state that is very fast and cheap, at the expense of decentralisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If required, the digital asset layer can refer back to the base layer to temporarily give up speed in exchange for
increased security. This fallback is used to resolve consensus issues on the second layer that may crop up from time to
time as a result of the lower degree of decentralisation.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-base-layer" id="the-base-layer"><h3>The Base Layer</h3></a>
<p><em>Refer to <a href="RFC-0100_BaseLayer.html">RFC-0100/BaseLayer</a> for more detail</em>.</p>
<p>The Tari base layer has the following primary features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof of work-based blockchain using Nakamoto consensus</li>
<li>Transactions and blocks based on the <a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> protocol</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="Glossary.html#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a> is an exciting new blockchain protocol that offers some key advantages over other <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>-based
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transactions are private. This means that casual observers cannot ascertain the amounts being transferred or the
identities of the parties involved.</li>
<li>Mimblewimble employs a novel blockchain &quot;compression&quot; method called cut-through that dramatically reduces the
storage requirements for blockchain nodes.</li>
<li>Multi-signature transactions can be easily aggregated, making such transactions very compact, and completely hiding
the parties involved, or the fact that there were multiple parties involved at all.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mimblewimble is the most sound, scalable 'base layer' protocol we know&quot; -- @fluffypony</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#proof-of-work" id="proof-of-work"><h4>Proof of work</h4></a>
<p>There are a few options for the proof of work mechanism for Tari:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement an existing PoW mechanism. This is a bad idea, because a nascent cryptocurrency that uses a non-unique
mining algorithm is incredibly vulnerable to a 51% attack from miners from other currencies using the same algorithm.
Bitcoin Gold and Verge have already experienced this, and it's a <a href="https://www.crypto51.app/">matter of time</a> before it
happens to others.</li>
<li>Implement a unique PoW algorithm. This is a risky approach and comes close to breaking the #1 rule of
cryptocurrency design: Never roll your own crypto.</li>
<li><a href="https://tari-labs.github.io/tari-university/merged-mining/merged-mining-scene/MergedMiningIntroduction.html">Merge mining</a>.
This approach is not without its own risks but offers the best trade-offs in terms of bootstrapping the network. It
typically provides high levels of hash rate from day one along with 51% attack resistance assuming mining pools are
well-distributed.</li>
<li>A hybrid approach, utilising two or more of the above mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given Tari's relationship with Monero, a merge-mined strategy with Monero makes the most sense, but the PoW mechanism
SHOULD be written in a way that makes it relatively easy to code, implement and switch to a different strategy in the
future.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-digital-assets-network" id="the-digital-assets-network"><h3>The Digital Assets Network</h3></a>
<p>A more detailed proposal for the digital assets network is presented in <a href="RFC-0300_DAN.html">RFC-0300/DAN</a>. Digital assets
<em>are discussed in more detail in <a href="RFC-0310_AssetTemplates.html">RFC-0310/Assets</a>.</em></p>
<p>The Tari digital assets network (DAN) consists of a peer-to-peer network of <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator nodes</a>. These nodes ensure the
safe and efficient operation of all native digital assets on the Tari network.</p>
<p>Validator nodes are responsible for</p>
<ul>
<li><em>registering</em> themselves on the base layer.</li>
<li>validating and executing the contracts that <em>create</em> and issue <em>new digital assets</em> on the network.</li>
<li>validating and executing <em>instructions</em> for <em>changes in state</em> of digital assets, for example allowing the transfer of
ownership of a token from one person to another.</li>
<li><em>Maintaining consensus</em> with other validator nodes managing the same asset.</li>
<li>submitting periodic <em>checkpoints</em> to the base layer for the state of assets under their management.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DAN is focused on achieving high speed and scalability, without compromising on security. To achieve
this we make the explicit trade-off of sacrificing decentralisation.</p>
<p>In many ways this is desirable, since the vast majority of assets (and their issuers) don't need or want <em>the entire
network</em> to validate every state change in their asset contracts.</p>
<p>Digital assets necessarily have <em>state</em>. Therefore the digital assets layer must have a means of synchronising and
agreeing on state that is managed simultaneously by multiple servers (a.k.a. reaching consensus).</p>
<p>Please refer to Tari Labs University for detailed discussions on
<a href="https://tlu.tarilabs.com/layer2scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/layer2scaling-survey.html">layer 2 scaling solutions</a>
and

<a class="header" href="#interaction-between-the-base-layer-and-the-dan" id="interaction-between-the-base-layer-and-the-dan"><h3>Interaction between the base layer and the DAN</h3></a>
<p>The base layer provides supporting services to the digital asset network. In general, the base layer only knows about
Tari coin transactions. It knows nothing about the details of any digital assets and their state.</p>
<p>This is by design: The network cannot scale if details of digital asset contracts have to be tracked on the base layer.
We envisage that there could be tens of thousands of contracts deployed on Tari. Some of those contracts may be enormous;
imagine controlling every piece of inventory and their live statistics for a MMORPG. The base layer is also too slow. If
<em>any</em> state relies on base layer transactions being confirmed, there is an immediate lag before that state change can be
considered final, which kills the liveness properties we seek for the DAN.</p>
<p>It's better to keep the two networks almost totally decoupled from the outset, and allow each network to play to its
strength.</p>
<p>That said, there are key interactions between the two layers. The base layer is a ledger and so it can be used as a
source of truth for the DAN to use as a type of registrar as well as final court of appeal in the case of consensus
disputes. This is what gives the DAN a secure fallback in case bad actors try to manipulate asset state by taking
advantage of its non-decentralisation.</p>
<p>These interactions require making provision for additional transaction types, in addition to payment and coinbase
transactions, that mark validator node registrations, contract collateral and so on.</p>
<p>The interplay between base layer and DAN is what incentivises every actor in the system to maintain an efficient and
well-functioning network even while acting in their own self-interests.</p>

<p>This RFC describes and explains the Tari codebase layout.</p>

<p>None.</p>
<a class="header" href="#description-1" id="description-1"><h2>Description</h2></a>
<p>The code follows a Domain-Driven Design layout (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" title="Wikipedia: Domain Driven Design">DDD</a>), with top-level directories falling into infrastructure, domain
and application layers.</p>
<a class="header" href="#infrastructure-layer" id="infrastructure-layer"><h3>Infrastructure layer</h3></a>
<p>This layer provides a set of crates which have general infrastructural utility. The rest of the Tari codebase can make use
of these crates to obtain persistence, communication and cryptographic services. The infrastructure layer doesn't know
anything about blockchains, transactions, or digital assets.</p>
<p>We recommend that code in this layer generalises infrastructure services behind abstraction layers as much as is
reasonable, so that specific implementations can be swapped out with relative ease.</p>
<a class="header" href="#domain-layer" id="domain-layer"><h3>Domain layer</h3></a>
<p>The Domain layer houses the Tari &quot;business logic&quot;. All protocol-related concepts and procedures are defined and
implemented here.</p>
<p>This entails that any and all terms defined in the <a href="../Glossary.html" title="Glossary">Glossary</a> will have a software implementation here, and only here.
They can be <em>used</em> in the Application layer, but must be implemented in the Domain layer.</p>
<p>The domain layer can make use of crates in the infrastructure layer to achieve its goals.</p>
<a class="header" href="#application-layer" id="application-layer"><h3>Application layer</h3></a>
<p>Applications build on top of the domain layer to produce the executable software that is deployed as part of the Tari
network.</p>
<p>As an example, the following base layer applications may be developed as part of the Tari protocol release:</p>
<ul>
<li>A standalone miner (tari_miner)</li>
<li>A pool miner (tari_pool_miner)</li>
<li>A CLI wallet for the Tari cryptocurrency (cli_wallet)</li>
<li>A base node executable (tari_basenode)</li>
<li>A REST API server for the base node</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#code-layout" id="code-layout"><h3>Code layout</h3></a>
<p>The top-level source code directories in this repository reflect the respective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" title="Wikipedia: Domain Driven Design">DDD</a> layers; except that there are two
domain layer directories, corresponding to the two network layers that make up the Tari network.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>infrastructure</code> directory contains application-layer code and is not Tari-specific. It holds the following
crates:
<ul>
<li><code>comms</code>: The networking and messaging subsystem</li>
<li><code>crypto</code>: All cryptographic services, including a Curve25519 implementation</li>
<li><code>storage</code>: Data persistence services, including an LMDB persistence implementation</li>
<li><code>merklemountainrange</code>: Ann independant implementation of a merkle mountain range</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>base_layer</code> is a domain-layer directory and contains:
<ul>
<li><code>blockchain</code>: The Tari consensus code</li>
<li><code>core</code>: common classes and traits, such as <a href="../Glossary.html#transaction">Transaction</a>s and <a href="../Glossary.html#block">Block</a>s</li>
<li><code>mempool</code>: The unconfirmed transaction pool implementation</li>
<li><code>mining</code>: The merge-mining modules</li>
<li><code>p2p</code>: The block and transaction propagation module</li>
<li><code>api</code>: interfaces for clients and wallets to interact with the base layer components</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>digital_assets_layer</code> is a domain-layer directory. It contains code related to the management of native Tari digital
assets.
<ul>
<li>Its sub-structure is TBD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>applications</code> contains crates for all the application-layer executables that form part of the Tari codebase.</li>

<p>The Tari Base Layer network comprises the following major pieces of software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Layer full node implementation - The base layer full nodes are the consensus-critical pieces of software for the
Tari base layer and cryptocurrency. The base nodes validate and transmit transactions and blocks and maintain
consensus about the longest valid proof-of-work blockchain.</li>
<li>Mining software - Mining nodes perform proof-of-work to secure the base layer and compete to submit the
next valid block into the Tari blockchain. Tari is merge-mined with Monero. The Tari source provides two alternatives
for Tari miners:
<ul>
<li>A standalone miner</li>
<li>A stratum-compatible pool miner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wallet software - Client software and APIs offering means to construct transactions, query nodes for information and
maintain personal private keys</li>
</ul>
<p>These three main pieces of software make use of common functionality provided by the following libraries within the Tari
project source code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local data storage</li>
<li>Cryptography services</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer networking and messaging services</li>

<p>The process of merged mining Tari with Monero on the Tari Base Layer is performed by <a href="Glossary.html#mining-server">Mining Server</a>s and <a href="Glossary.html#mining-worker">Mining
Worker</a>s. Mining Servers are responsible for constructing new blocks by bundling transactions from the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a>
of a connected Base Node. They then distribute Proof-of-Work(PoW) tasks to Mining Workers in an attempt to solve
newly created blocks. Solved solutions and shares are sent by the Mining Workers to the Mining Server, who in turns
verifies the solution and distributes the newly created blocks to the Base Node and Monero Node for inclusion in
their respective blockchains.</p>
<a class="header" href="#merged-mining-on-the-tari-base-layer" id="merged-mining-on-the-tari-base-layer"><h3>Merged mining on the Tari Base Layer</h3></a>
<p>This document is divided into three parts. First, a brief overview of the merged mining process and the interactions
between the Base Node, Mining Server and Mining Worker will be provided, then the primary functionality required
of the Mining Server and Mining Worker will be proposed.</p>
<a class="header" href="#overview-of-the-tari-merged-mining-process-using-mining-servers-and-mining-workers" id="overview-of-the-tari-merged-mining-process-using-mining-servers-and-mining-workers"><h4>Overview of the Tari merged mining process using Mining Servers and Mining Workers</h4></a>
<p>Mining on the Tari Base Layer consists of three primary entities: the Base Nodes, Mining Servers and Mining Workers.
A description of the Base Node is provided in [RFC-0110/Base Nodes] (https://tari-project.github.io/tari/RFC-0110_BaseNodes.html).
A Mining Server is connected locally or remotely to a Tari Base Node and a Monero Node, and is responsible for
constructing Tari and Monero Blocks from their respective mempools. The Mining Server should retrieve transactions
from the mempool of the connected Base Node and assemble a new Tari block by bundling transactions together.</p>
<p>Mining servers may re-verify transactions before including them in a new Tari block, but this enforcement of
verification and transaction rules such as signatures and timelocks are the responsibility of the connected Base node. Mining servers are responsible for <a href="RFC-0140_Syncing.html#Pruning-and-cut-through">cut-through</a> as this is required for scalability and privacy.</p>
<p>To enable Merged mining of Tari with Monero, both a Tari and a Monero block needs to be created and linked. First,
a new Tari block is created and then the block header hash of the new Tari block is included in the coinbase
transaction of the new Monero block. Once a new merged mined Monero block has been constructed, PoW tasks can then
be sent to the connected Mining Workers that will attempt to solve the block by performing the latest released
version of the PoW algorithm selected by Monero.</p>
<p>Assuming the Tari difficulty is less than the Monero difficulty, miners get rewarded for solving the PoW at any
difficulty above the Tari difficulty. If the block is solved above the Tari difficulty, a new Tari block is mined.
If the difficulty is also greater than the Monero difficulty, a new Monero block is mined as well. In either event,
the header for the candidate Monero block is included in the Tari block header.</p>
<p>If the PoW solution was sufficient to meet the difficult level of both the Tari and Monero blockchains, then the
individual blocks for each blockchain can be sent from the Mining Server to the Base Node and Monero Node to be
added to the respective blockchains.</p>
<p>Every Tari block must include the solved Monero block’s information (block header hash, Merkle tree branch, and
hash of the coinbase transaction) into the PoW summary section of the Tari block header.
If the PoW solution found by the Mining Workers only solved the problem at the Tari difficulty, the Monero block can be discarded.</p>
<p>This process will ensure that the Tari difficulty remains independent. Adjusting the difficulty will ensure that
the Tari block times are preserved. Also, the Tari block time can be less than, equal
or greater than the Monero block times. A more detailed description of the Merged Mining process between a Primary
and Auxiliary blockchain is provided in the [Merged Mining TLU report] (https://tlu.tarilabs.com/merged-mining/merged-mining.html).</p>

<a class="header" href="#syncing" id="syncing"><h3>Syncing</h3></a>
<p>When a new node comes online, loses connection or encounters a chain re-organisation that is longer than it can tolerate, it must enter syncing mode. This will allow it to recover its state to the newest up to date state. Syncing can be divided into 2 <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstrategy">SynchronisationStrategy</a>s, complete sync and sync. Complete sync will mean that the node communicates with an archive node to get the complete history of every single block from genesis block. Sync will involve the node getting every block from its <a href="pruninghorizon">pruning horizon</a> to [current head](current head), as well as every block header from genesis block.</p>
<a class="header" href="#complete-sync" id="complete-sync"><h4>Complete Sync</h4></a>
<p>Complete sync is only available from archive nodes, as these will be the only nodes that will be able to supply the complete history required to sync every block with every transaction from genesis block up onto <a href="currenthead">current head</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#syncing-process" id="syncing-process"><h4>Syncing process</h4></a>
<p>The syncing process MUST be done in the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronisationState</a> to <code>Synchronising</code>.</li>
<li>Asks peers for their latest block, so it can get the total proof of work.</li>
<li>Choose the longest chain based on total PoW done on that chain.</li>
<li>Selects a connected peer with the longest chain to sync from, this is based on the following criteria:
<ol>
<li>Does the peer have a high enough <a href="pruninghorizon">pruning horizon</a>.</li>
<li>Does the peer allow syncing.</li>
<li>Does the peer have a low latency.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Download all headers from genesis block up onto <a href="currenthead">current head</a>, and validate the headers as you receive them.</li>
<li>Download <a href="utxo">UTXO</a> set at <a href="pruninghorizon">pruning horizon</a>.</li>
<li>Download all blocks from  <a href="pruninghorizon">pruning horizon</a> up to <a href="currenthead">current head</a>, if the node is doing a complete sync, the <a href="pruninghorizon">pruning horizon</a> will just be infinite, which means you will download all blocks ever created.</li>
<li>Validate blocks as if they where just mined and then received, in chronological order.</li>
</ol>
<p>After this process the node will be in sync and able to process blocks and transaction normally.</p>
<a class="header" href="#keeping-in-sync" id="keeping-in-sync"><h4>Keeping in sync</h4></a>
<p>The node SHOULD periodically test its peers with ping messages to ensure that they are alive. When a node sends a ping message, it MUST include the current total PoW, hash of the <a href="currenthead">current head</a> and genesis block hash of its own current longest chain in the ping message. The receiving node MUST reply with a pong message also including the total PoW, <a href="currenthead">current head</a> and genesis block hash of its longest chain. If the two chains don't match up, the node with the lowest PoW has the responsibility to ask the peer for syncing information and set <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronisationState</a> to <code>Synchronising</code>.</p>
<p>If the genesis block hashes don't match, the node is removed from its peer list as this node is running a different blockchain.</p>
<p>This will be handled by the node asking for each block header from the <a href="currenthead">current head</a> going backward for older blocks until a known block is found. If a known block is found, and it has missing blocks it MUST set <a href="Glossary.html#synchronisationstate">SynchronisationState</a> to <code>Synchronising</code> while it is busy catching up those blocks.</p>
<p>If no block is found, the node will enter sync mode and resync. It cannot recover from its state as the fork is older than its <a href="pruninghorizon">pruning horizon</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#chain-forks" id="chain-forks"><h4>Chain forks</h4></a>
<p>Chain forks can be a problem since in Mimblewimble not all nodes keep the complete transaction history, the design philosophy is more along the lines of only keeping the current <a href="blockchainstate">Blockchain state</a>. However, if such a node only maintains only the current <a href="blockchainstate">Blockchain state</a> it is not possible for the node to &quot;rewind&quot; its state to handle forks in the chain history. In this case, a mode must re-sync its chain to recover the necessary transaction history up onto its <a href="pruninghorizon">pruning horizon</a>.</p>
<p>To counter this problem we use  <a href="pruninghorizon">pruning horizon</a>, this allows every [node](base node) to be a &quot;light&quot; <a href="archivenode">archival node</a>. This in effect means that the node will keep a full history for a short while. If the node encounters a fork it can easily rewind its state to apply the fork. If the fork is longer than the <a href="pruninghorizon">pruning horizon</a>, the node will enter a sync state where it will resync.</p>
<a class="header" href="#pruning-and-cut-through" id="pruning-and-cut-through"><h3>Pruning and cut-through</h3></a>
<p>[Pruning and cut-through]: #Pruning-and-cut-through &quot;Remove already spent outputs from the <a href="Glossary.html#unspent-transaction-outputs">utxo</a>&quot;</p>
<p>In Mimblewimble, the state can be completely verified using the current <a href="utxo">UTXO</a> set (which contains the output commitments and range proofs), the set of excess signatures (contained in the transaction kernels) and the proof-of-work. The full block and transaction history is not required. This allows base layer nodes to remove old used inputs from the <a href="Glossary.html#blockchain">blockchain</a> and or the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a>. <a href="cut-through">Cut-through</a> happens in the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a> while pruning happens in the <a href="Glossary.html#blockchain">blockchain</a> with already confirmed transactions. This will remove the spent inputs and outputs, but will retain the excesses of each <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>.</p>
<p>Pruning is only for the benefit of the local base node as it reduces the local blockchain size. Pruning only happens after the block is older than the <a href="pruninghorizon">pruning horizon</a> height. A Base node will either run in archive mode or prune mode, if the base node is running in archive mode it MUST NOT prune.</p>
<p>When running in pruning mode, <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a>s have the following responsibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>MUST remove all spent outputs that is older than the <a href="pruninghorizon">pruning horizon</a> in it's current stored <a href="utxo">UTXO</a> when a new block is received from another <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">base node</a>.</li>

</ul>
<a class="header" href="#abstract-2" id="abstract-2"><h3>Abstract</h3></a>
<p>The backbone of the Tari communication network consists of a large number of nodes that maintain peer connections between each other.
These nodes forward and propagate encrypted and unencrypted data messages through the network such as joining requests, discovery requests, <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a>s and completed <a href="Glossary.html#block">block</a>s.
Network clients, not responsible for maintaining the network, are able to create ad hoc connections with nodes on the network to perform joining and discovery requests.
The majority of communication between clients and nodes will be performed using direct Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication once the discovery process was used to obtain the online communication addresses of peers.
Where possible the efficient Kademlia based directed forwarding of encrypted data messages can be used to perform quick node discovery and joining of clients and nodes on the Tari communication network.
Where messages are of importance to a wide variety of entities on the network, Gossip protocol based message propagation can be performed to distribute the message to the entire network.</p>
<a class="header" href="#overview" id="overview"><h3>Overview</h3></a>
<p>The Tari communication network is a variant of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> network that allows for fast discovery of nodes, with an added ability to perform Gossip protocol based broadcasting of data messages to the entire network.
The majority of the communication required on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">Base Layer</a> and <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-network">Digital Asset Network</a> (DAN) will be performed via direct P2P communication between known clients and nodes.
Alternatively, the Tari communication network can be used for broadcasting joining requests, discovery requests and propagating data messages such as completed blocks, transactions and data messages that are of interest to a large part of the Tari communication network.</p>
<p>The Tari communication network consists of a number of different entities that need to communicate in a distributed and ad-hoc manner.
The primary entities that need to communicate are Validator Nodes (VN), <a href="Glossary.html#base-node">Base Node</a>s (BN), <a href="Glossary.html#wallet">Wallet</a>s (W) and <a href="Glossary.html#token-wallet">Token Wallet</a>s (TW).
Here are some examples of different communication tasks that need to be performed by these entities on the Tari Communication network:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Nodes on the Base Layer need to propagate completed blocks and transactions to other Base Nodes using Gossip protocol based broadcasting.</li>
<li>Validator Nodes need to efficiently discover other Validator Nodes in the process of forming Validator Node committees.</li>
<li>Wallets need to communicate and negotiate with other Wallets to create transactions. They also need the ability to submit transactions to the <a href="Glossary.html#mempool">mempool</a> of Base Nodes.</li>
<li>Token Wallets need to communicate with Validator Node <a href="Glossary.html#committee">committee</a>s and other Token Wallets to construct and send DAN instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an overview communication matrix that show which source entities SHOULD initiate communication with destination entities on the Tari Communication network:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>         \Destination<br>Source </th><th> Validator Node </th><th> Base Node </th><th> Wallet </th><th> Token Wallet </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> Validator Node         </td><td> Yes            </td><td> Yes       </td><td> Yes    </td><td> Yes          </td></tr>
<tr><td> Base Node              </td><td> No             </td><td> Yes       </td><td> No     </td><td> No           </td></tr>
<tr><td> Wallet                 </td><td> No             </td><td> Yes       </td><td> Yes    </td><td> No           </td></tr>
<tr><td> Token Wallet           </td><td> Yes            </td><td> No        </td><td> Yes    </td><td> Yes          </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<a class="header" href="#communication-nodes-and-communication-clients" id="communication-nodes-and-communication-clients"><h4>Communication Nodes and Communication Clients</h4></a>
<p>To simplify the description of the Tari communication network, the different entities with similar behaviour were grouped into two groups: Communication Nodes and Communication Clients.
Validator Nodes and Base Nodes are Communication Nodes (CN).
Wallets and Token Wallets are Communication Clients (CC).
CNs form the core communication infrastructure of the Tari communication network and are responsible for maintaining the Tari communication network by receiving, forwarding and distributing joining requests, discovery requests, data messages and routing information.
CCs are different from CNs in that they do not maintain the network and they are not responsible for propagating any joining requests, discovery requests, data messages and routing information.
They do make use of the network to submit their own joining requests and perform discovery request of other specific CNs and CCs when they need to communicate with them.
Once a CC has discovered the CC or CN they want to communicate with, they will establish a direct P2P channel with them.
The Tari communication network is unaware of this direct P2P communication once discovery is completed.</p>
<p>The different entity types MUST be grouped into the different communication node types as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th> Entity Type    </th><th> Communication Node Type </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> Validator Node </td><td> Communication Node      </td></tr>
<tr><td> Base Node      </td><td> Communication Node      </td></tr>
<tr><td> Wallet         </td><td> Communication Client    </td></tr>
<tr><td> Token Wallet   </td><td> Communication Client    </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<a class="header" href="#unique-identification-of-communication-nodes-and-communication-clients" id="unique-identification-of-communication-nodes-and-communication-clients"><h4>Unique identification of Communication Nodes and Communication Clients</h4></a>
<p>In the Tari communication network, each CN or CC makes use of a node ID to determine their position in the network.
This node ID is either assigned based on registration on the Base Layer or can be derived from the CNs or CCs identification public key.
The method used to obtain a node ID will either enhance or limit the trustworthiness of that entity when propagating messages through them on the Tari communication network.
When performing the broadcasting of data messages or propagating discovery requests, nodes with registration assigned node IDs are considered more trustworthy compared to nodes with derived node IDs.</p>
<p>Obtaining a node ID from registration on the Base Layer is important as it will limit the potential of some parties performing <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/263.pdf">Eclipse attacks</a> on the network.
Registration makes it more difficult for <a href="Glossary.html#bad-actor">Bad Actor</a>s to position themselves in ideal patterns on the network to perform disruptive operations and actions.
In sensitive situations or situations where the Kademlia-style directed propagation of messages are vulnerable, gossip protocol-based broadcasting of messages can be performed as a less efficient, but safer alternative to ensure that the message will successfully reach the rest of the network.</p>
<p>The similarity or distance between different node IDs can be calculated by performing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming distance</a> between the bits of the two node ID numbers.
The Hamming distance can be implemented as an Exclusive OR (XOR) between the bits of the numbers and the summation of the resulting true bits.
CCs and/or CNs that have similar node IDs, that produce a small Hamming distance, are located in similar regions of the Tari communication network.
This does not mean that their geographic locations are near each other, but rather that their location in the network is similar.
A thresholding scheme can be applied to the Hamming distance to ensure that only neighboring CNs with similar node IDs are allowed to share and propagate specific information.
As an example, only routing table information that contains similar node IDs to the requesting CCs or CNs node ID should be shared with them.
Limiting the sharing of routing table information makes it more difficult to map the entire Tari communication network.</p>
<p>The recommended method of node ID assignment for each Tari communication network entity type MUST be implemented as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th> Entity Type    </th><th> Communication Node Type </th><th> Node ID Assignment </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> Validator Node </td><td> Communication Node      </td><td> Registration       </td></tr>
<tr><td> Base Node      </td><td> Communication Node      </td><td> Derived            </td></tr>
<tr><td> Wallet         </td><td> Communication Client    </td><td> Derived            </td></tr>
<tr><td> Token Wallet   </td><td> Communication Client    </td><td> Derived            </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Note that <a href="Glossary.html#mining-server">Mining Server</a>s and <a href="Glossary.html#mining-worker">Mining Worker</a>s are excluded from the Tari communication network.
A Mining Worker will have a local or remote P2P connection with a Mining Server.
A Mining Server will have a local or remote P2P connection with a Base Node.
They do not need to make use of the communication network and they are not responsible for propagating any messages on the network.
The parent Base Node will perform any communication tasks on the Tari communication network on their behalf.</p>
<a class="header" href="#online-communication-address-peer-address-and-routing-table" id="online-communication-address-peer-address-and-routing-table"><h4>Online Communication Address, Peer Address and Routing Table</h4></a>
<p>Each CC and CN on the Tari communication network will have identification cryptographic keys, a node ID and an online communication address.
The online communication address SHOULD be either an IPv4, IPv6, URL, Tor (Base32) or I2P (Base32) address and can be stored using the network address type as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th> Description  </th><th> Data type  </th><th> Comments                                            </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> address type </td><td> uint4      </td><td> Specify if IPv4/IPv6/Url/Tor/I2P                    </td></tr>
<tr><td> address      </td><td> char array </td><td> IPv4, IPv6, URL, Tor (Base32), I2P (Base32) address </td></tr>
<tr><td> port         </td><td> uint16     </td><td> port number                                         </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The address type is used to determine how to interpret the address characters. An I2P address can be interpreted as &quot;{52 address characters}.b32.i2p&quot;.
The Tor address should be interpreted as &quot;http://{16 or 52 address chars}.onion/&quot;.
The IPv4 and IPv6 address can be stored in the address field without modification.
URL addresses can be used for nodes with dynamic IP addresses.</p>
<p>A Tor or I2P address can be used when anonymity is important for a CC or CN.
The IPv4, IPv6 and URL address types do not provide any privacy features but do provide increased bandwidth.</p>
<p>Each CC or CN has a local routing table that contains the online communication addresses of all CCs and CNs on the Tari communication network known to that CC or CN.
When a CC or CN wants to join the Tari communication network, the online communication address of at least one other CN that is part of the network needs to be known.
The online communication address of the initial CN can either be manually provided or a bootstrapped list of &quot;reliable&quot; and persistent CNs can be provided with the Validator Node, Base Node, Wallet or Token Wallet software.
The new CC or CN can then request additional peer contact information of other CNs from the initial peers to extend their own routing table.</p>
<p>The routing table consists of a list of peer addresses that link node IDs, public identification keys and online communication addresses of each known CC and CN.</p>
<p>The Peer Address stored in the routing table MAY be implemented as follows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th> Description      </th><th> Data type          </th><th> Comments                                                                 </th></tr></thead><tbody>

<tr><td> linked asset IDs </td><td> list of asset IDs  </td><td> Asset IDs can be used as an address on Tari network similar to a node ID </td></tr>
<tr><td> last_connection  </td><td> timestamp          </td><td> Time of last successful connection with peer                             </td></tr>
<tr><td> update_timestamp </td><td> timestamp          </td><td> A timestamp for the last peer address update                             </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>When a new CC or CN wants to join the Tari communication network they need to submit a joining request to the rest of the network.
The joining request contains the peer address of the new CC or CN.
Each CN that receives the joining request can decide if they want to add the new CCs or CNs contact information to their local routing table.
When a CN, that received the joining request, has a similar node ID to the new CC or CN then that node must add the peer address to their routing table.
All CNs with similar node IDs to the new CC or CN should have a copy of the new peer address in their routing tables.</p>
<p>To limit potential attacks, only one registration for a specific node type with the same online communication address can be stored in the routing table of a CN.
This restriction will limit Bad Actors from spinning up multiple CNs on a single computer.</p>
<a class="header" href="#joining-the-network-using-a-joining-request" id="joining-the-network-using-a-joining-request"><h4>Joining the Network using a Joining Request</h4></a>
<p>A new CC or CN needs to register their peer address on the Tari communication network.
This is achieved by submitting a network joining request to a subset of CNs selected from the routing table of the new CC or CN.
These peers will forward the joining request, with the peer address, to the rest of the network until CNs with similar node IDs have been reached.
CNs with similar node IDs will then add the new peer address of the new node to their routing table, allowing for fast discovery of the new CC or CN.</p>
<p>Other CCs and CNs will then be able to retrieve the new CCs or CNs peer address by submitting discovery requests.
Once the peer address of the desired CC or CN has been discovered then a direct P2P communication channel can be established between the two parties for any future communication.
After discovery, the rest of the Tari communication network will be unaware of any further communication between the two parties.</p>
<a class="header" href="#sending-data-messages-and-discovery-requests" id="sending-data-messages-and-discovery-requests"><h4>Sending Data Messages and Discovery Requests</h4></a>
<p>The majority of all communication on the Tari communication network will be performed using direct P2P channels established between different CCs and CNs once they are aware of the peer addresses of each other that contain their online communication addresses.
Message propagation on the network will typically consist only of joining and discovery requests where a CC or CN wants to join the network or retrieve the peer address of another CC or CN so that a direct P2P channel can be established.</p>
<p>Messages can be transmitted in this network in either an unencrypted or encrypted form.
Typically messages that have been sent in unencrypted form are of interest to a number of CNs on the network and should be propagated so that every CN that is interested in that data message obtains a copy.
Block and Transaction propagation are examples of data messages where multiple entities on the Tari communication network are interested in that data message; this requires propagation through the entire Tari communication network in unencrypted form.</p>
<p>Encrypted data messages make use of the source and destinations identification cryptographic keys to construct a shared secret with which the message can be encoded and decoded.
This ensures that only the two parties are able to decode the data message as it is propagated through the communication network.
This mechanism can be used to perform private discovery requests, where the online communication address of the source node is encrypted and propagated through the network until it reached the destination node.
Private discovery requests can only be performed if both parties are online at the same time.
Encryption of the data message ensures that only the destination node is able to view the online address of the source node as the data message moves through the network.
Once the destination node receives and decrypts the data message, that node is then able to establish a P2P communication channel with the source node for any further communication.</p>
<p>Propagation of completely private discovery request, hidden as an encrypted data message, can be performed as a broadcast through the entire network using the Gossip protocol.
Propagation of public discovery requests can be performed using more efficient directed propagation using the Kademlia protocol.
As encrypted message with visible destinations tend to not be of interest to the rest of the network, directed propagation using the Kademlia protocol to forward these messages to the correct parties are preferred.
Privacy of a CCs online address, whom is sending a transaction to a Base Node, may be enhanced if the transaction is encrypted and sent to a Base Node with a node ID that is not the closest to the CCs node ID. This should prevent linking a transaction to the originating online address.</p>
<p>This same encryption technique can be used to send encrypted messages to a single node or a group of nodes, where the group of nodes have shared identification keys.
A Validation Committee is an example of a group of CNs that have shared identification keys for the committee.
The shared identification keys ensure that all members of that committee are able to receive and decrypt data messages that were sent to the committee.</p>
<a class="header" href="#maintaining-connections-with-peers" id="maintaining-connections-with-peers"><h4>Maintaining connections with peers</h4></a>
<p>CCs and CNs establish and maintain connections with peers differently.
CCs only create a few short-lived ad hoc channels and CNs create and maintain long-lived channels with a number of peers.</p>
<p>If a CC is unaware of a destination CNs or CCs online communication address then the address first needs to be obtained using a discovery request.
When a CC already knows the communication address of the CC or CN that he wants to communicate with, then a direct P2P channel can be established between the two peers for the duration of the communication task.
The communication channel can then be closed as soon as the communication task has been completed.</p>
<p>CNs consisting of VNs and BNs typically attempt to maintain communication channels with a large number of peers.
The distribution of peers (VNs vs BNs) that a single CN keeps communication channels open with can change depending on the type of node.
A CN that is also a BN should maintain more peer connections with other BNs, but should also have some connections with other VNs.</p>
<p>Having some connections with VNs are important as BNs have derived node IDs and not registered node IDs such as VNs, making it possible for the CN to be separated from the main network and become victim to an <a href="https://www.radixdlt.com/post/what-is-an-eclipse-attack">Eclipse attack</a>.
Having some connections with VNs will make it more difficult to separate the CN from the network and will ensure successful propagation of transactions and completed blocks from that CN.</p>
<p>A CN that is also a VN should maintain more peer connections with other VNs, but also have some connections with BNs.
CNs that are part of Validator Node committees should attempt to maintain permanent connections with the other members of the committee to ensure that quick consensus can be achieved.</p>
<p>To maintain connections with peers, the following process can be performed.
Discover peers using discovery requests, and add their details to the local routing table.
The CN can decide how the peer connections should be selected from the routing table by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>manually selecting a subset,</li>
<li>automatically selecting a random subset or</li>
<li>selecting a subset of neighbouring nodes with similar node IDs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintaining communication channels is important and the following process can be followed in an attempt to keep peer connections alive:
For an existing peer connection.
When more than 30 minutes have passed since the last communication with that peer, then a heartbeat message should be sent to the peer in an attempt to keep the connection with the peer alive.
If the peer connection was not established for a specific purpose, such as with the connections between committee members, then a new replacement peer can be selected from the local routing table.
A new connection can then be established and maintained between the current node and the newly selected node.
If that specific connection is important, such as with the connections between committee members, then the current CN or CC must wait and attempt to create a new connection with that same peer.
If more than 90 minutes have passed since the last successful communication with the peer node, a new discovery request can be sent on the Tari communication network in an attempt to locate that peer again.
Losing of a peer might happen in cases where the CN or CC went temporarily offline and their dynamic communication address changed, requiring the discovery process to be performed again before a direct P2P communication channel can be established.</p>

<a class="header" href="#abstract-3" id="abstract-3"><h3>Abstract</h3></a>
<p><a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">Digital asset</a>s (DAs) are managed by committees of special nodes called <a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator node</a>s (VNs). VNs manage digital asset state change and ensure
that the rules of the asset contracts are enforced.</p>
<ul>
<li>VNs form a peer-to-peer communication network that together defines the Tari <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-network">Digital Asset Network</a> (DAN)</li>
<li>VNs register themselves on the base layer and commit collateral to prevent Sybil attacks.</li>
<li>Scalability is achieved by sacrificing decentralisation. Not <em>all</em> VNs manage <em>every</em> asset. Assets are managed by
subsets of the DAN, called VN committees. These committees reach consensus on DA state amongst themselves.</li>
<li>VNs earn fees for their efforts.</li>
<li>Digital asset contracts are not Turing complete, but are instantiated by <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a>s (AIs) using Digital Asset templates that are defined
in the DAN protocol code.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#digital-assets" id="digital-assets"><h3>Digital Assets</h3></a>
<ul>
<li>Digital asset contracts are <em>not</em> Turing complete, but are selected from a set of <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a>s that govern
the behaviour of each contract type. e.g. there could be a Single-Use Token template for simple ticketing systems; a
Coupon template for loyalty programmes and so on.</li>
<li>The template system is intended to be highly flexible and additional templates can be added to the protocol periodically.</li>
<li>Asset issuers can register Top-Level Digital Issuer (TLDI) names on the base chain to help disambiguate similar
contracts and improve the signal-to-noise ratio from scam- or copy-cat contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p>An <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a> (AI) will issue a Digital Assets by constructing a contract from one of the supported set of <a href="Glossary.html#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a>s. The AI will choose
how large the committee of Validator Nodes will be for this DA and have the option to nominate <a href="Glossary.html#trusted-node">Trusted Node</a>s to be part of the VN committee for the DA.
Any remaining spots on the committee will be filled by permissionless VNs that are selected according to a <a href="Glossary.html#committeeselectionstrategy">CommitteeSelectionStrategy</a>. This is a strategy
for the DAN to algorithmically select candidates for the committee from the available registered Validator Nodes. The VNs will need to accept the nomination
to become part of the committee by putting up the specified collateral.</p>
<a class="header" href="#validator-nodes" id="validator-nodes"><h3>Validator Nodes</h3></a>
<p><a href="Glossary.html#validator-node">Validator Node</a>s form the basis of the second layer DAN. All actions on this network take place by interacting with VN's. Some examples of actions
that VNs will facilitate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issuing a <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">Digital Asset</a>,</li>
<li>querying the state of <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">Digital Asset</a> and its constituent <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-tokens">tokens</a>,</li>
<li>issuing an instruction to change the state of a <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">Digital Asset</a> or <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset-tokens">tokens</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>VNs will also perform archival functions for the assets they manage. The lifetime of these archives and the fee structure for this function is
still being discussed.</p>
<a class="header" href="#registration" id="registration"><h4>Registration</h4></a>
<p>VNs register themselves on the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">Base Layer</a> using a special <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> type. The registration <a href="Glossary.html#transaction">transaction</a> type
requires the spending of a certain minimum amount of <a href="Glossary.html#tari-coin">Tari coin</a>, the (<a href="Glossary.html#registrationcollateral">RegistrationCollateral</a>), that has a time-lock on the
output for a minimum amount of time (<a href="Glossary.html#registrationterm">RegistrationTerm</a>) as well as some metadata, such as the VNs public key and a generated <a href="Glossary.html#node-id">Node ID</a>. The Node ID is generated
during registration to prevent mining of VN public keys that can be used to manipulate routing on the DAN. The blinding factor for the Registration transaction is the private key
that the VN node will use to sign every instruction that it executes for the duration of its <a href="Glossary.html#registrationterm">RegistrationTerm</a>.</p>
<p>Once a VNs <a href="Glossary.html#registrationterm">RegistrationTerm</a> has expired so will this specific VN registration. The UTXO timelock will have elapsed so the <a href="Glossary.html#registrationcollateral">RegistrationCollateral</a> can be reclaimed and a new VN registration
need to be performed. This automatic registration expiry will ensure that the VN registry stays up to date with active VN registrations and inactive registrations will naturally be removed.</p>
<p>Requiring nodes to register themselves serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes VN Sybil attacks expensive,</li>
<li>Provides an authoritative &quot;central-but-not-centralised&quot; registry of validator nodes from the base layer.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#execution-of-instructions" id="execution-of-instructions"><h4>Execution of instructions</h4></a>
<p>VNs are expected to manage the state of digital assets on behalf of digital asset issuers. They receive fees as reward
for doing this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital assets consist of an initial state plus a set of state transition rules. These rules are set by the Tari
protocol, but will usually provide parameters that must be specified by the <a href="Glossary.html#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a>.</li>
<li>The set of VNs that participate in managing state of a specific DA is called a <a href="Glossary.html#committee">Committee</a>. A committee is selected during the asset
issuance process and membership of the committee can be updated at <a href="Glossary.html#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a>s.</li>
<li>It is the VNs responsibility to ensure that every state change in a digital asset conforms to the contract's rules.</li>
<li>VNs accept digital asset <a href="Glossary.html#instructions">Instructions</a> from clients and peers. <a href="Glossary.html#instructions">Instructions</a> allow for creating, updating, expiring and archiving digital assets on the DAN.</li>
<li>VNs provide additional collateral when accepting an offer to manage an asset, which is stored in a multi-signature
UTXO on the base layer. This collateral can be taken from the VN if it is proven that the VN engaged in
malicious behaviour.</li>
<li>VNs participate in fraud proof validations in the event of consensus disputes (which could result in the malicious VN's
collateral being slashed).</li>
<li>Digital asset metadata (e.g. large images) are managed by VNs. The large data itself will not be stored on the VNs but an external location and a hash of the data can be stored. Whether the data is considered part of the state
(and thus checkpointed) or out of state depends on the type of digital asset contract employed.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#fees" id="fees"><h4>Fees</h4></a>
<p>Fees will be paid to VNs based on the amount of work they did during a checkpoint period. The fees will be paid from a fee pool which will be collected
and reside in a UTXO that is accessible by the committee. The exact mechanism for the the payment of the fees by the committee and who pays the various
types of fees is still under discussion.</p>
<a class="header" href="#checkpoints" id="checkpoints"><h4>Checkpoints</h4></a>
<p>VNs periodically post checkpoint summaries to the <a href="Glossary.html#base-layer">base layer</a> for each asset that they are managing. The checkpoints will form an immutable
record of the <a href="Glossary.html#digital-asset">Digital Asset</a> state on the base-layer. There will be two types of checkpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An Opening checkpoint (OC) will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specify the members of the VN committee.</li>
<li>Lock up the collateral for the committee members for this checkpoint period.</li>
<li>Collect the fee pool for this checkpoint period from the Asset Issuer into a Multi-Sig UTXO under the control of the committee.
This can be a top-up of the fees or a whole new fee pool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Closing checkpoint (CC) will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarize the Digital Asset state on the base layer.</li>
<li>Release the fee pay outs.</li>
<li>Release the collateral for the committee members for this checkpoint period.</li>
<li>Allow for committee members to resign from the committee</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After an DA is issued there will immediately be an Opening checkpoint. After a checkpoint period there will then be a Closing checkpoint followed
immediately by an Opening checkpoint for the next period, we will call this set of checkpoints an Intermediate checkpoint, which could be a compressed combination of an opening and closing checkpoint. This will continue
until the end of the asset's lifetime where there will be a final Closing checkpoint that will be followed by the retirement of the asset.</p>

<p>Committees of VNs will use a <a href="Glossary.html#consensusstrategy">ConsensusStrategy</a> to manage the process of</p>
<ul>
<li>Propogating signed instructions between members of the committee.</li>
<li>Determining when the threshold has been reached for an instruction to be considered valid.</li>
</ul>

against bad actors are still to be decided.</p>
<a class="header" href="#network-communication" id="network-communication"><h3>Network communication</h3></a>
<p>The VNs will communicate using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. To facilitate this this VNs must perform the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>VNs MUST maintain a list of peers, and which assets each peer is managing.</li>
<li>VNs MUST relay <a href="Glossary.html#instructions">instructions</a> to members of the committee that are managing the relevant asset.</li>
<li>VNs MUST respond to requests for information about digital assets that they manage on the DAN.</li>
<li>VNs and clients can advertise public keys to facilitate P2P communication encryption</li>

<a class="header" href="#rfc-0500paymentchannels" id="rfc-0500paymentchannels"><h1>RFC-0500/PaymentChannels</h1></a>
<p>RFC placeholder.</p>
<p>This document will describe how Tari implements payment channels. The base layer is slow. The DAN is fast. However,
every non-read DAN instruction has a fee (i.e. base layer transaction) associated with it. To bridge the speed gap
between the two layers, a payment channel solution is required. This document provides the high-level overview of how
this is done.</p>
